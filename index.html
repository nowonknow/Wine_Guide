      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p> The initial motivation for this project comes from the anecdote by professor Pang.
         Professor Pang drank wine with his professor at the time and he thought it was a wine that was not special,
         but it turns out the wine costs $200 which surprised him.
         His anecdote motivated our team to create a website that visualizes the useful data set of components
         that determine the points/ price of wine. </p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> The quality of wine is decided by many factors.
        The factors that dictate the quality the most are prices and points by judges.
        However, there’s no clear norm or useful website that shows visual data sets on wines that help describe the quality of the wine.
        That results in confusion about the exact norm of wine among people who have less knowledge than people who are interested in wine.
        Moreover, due to its high price range, it’s also difficult for people to know what could be the difference between cheap wine and expensive wine.
        To cater to this the Wine Guide helps users visualize the data sets collected on various wines and their ratings
        by showing various relevant graphs to better grasp relationships between various attributes and their ratings. </p>

      <h2>List of Goals/Features</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Visualize wine ratings using a graph where users can specify different factors followed by points
          (i.e. Region vs points, price vs points,...etc.)
          Those factors decide the quality of wine which relates to points given by reviewers.</li>

          <li>Visualize wine ratings using a graph where users can specify different factors followed by price.
          (i.e. Region vs price, points vs price,...etc.)
          These factors help decide the price of the wine and can help users better understand why these wines are priced as such.</li>

          <li>Create CNN to learn on data set and utilize information from its model and learned variables to understand the importance of each row from learning.</li>
          <li>Visualize the physicochemical properties of wines to their quality. To understand on a lower level what physical properties go into a better wine. </li>
